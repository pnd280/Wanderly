FIXME:
Problems:
- Pagination
  + Dynamic or Static?
  + Search results overflow?
  
- Mobile screen size:
  + Still overflow on X axis?





TODO:
- Refactor CSS:
  + Use mixins
    [x] box shadows
    [x] primary gradient
    * gap between sections
  + Write better & reusable media queries

- Make navbar compatible with mobile screen size
- Make navbar sticky
